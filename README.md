## --- this is a copy with extra docblocks to support PhpStorm code inspection ---

I will attempt to keep the doc blocks up to date, specifically for PhpStorm.

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/Artistan/laraframe-docblock"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "laravel/framework": "docblock-methods"
    }
}

```

GOTO: <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework">Laravel/Framework</a> for the official up to date repository
